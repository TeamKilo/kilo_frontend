# Setup

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) can be used to install Node.js.

From the kilo-webapp directory, run `npm install`.

Then, `npm start` can be used to run a development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and `npm run build` can be used to build the app for production.
